# base64-32

A base-64 variant for encoding 32-byte values as text. Its present use case
is for recording SHA-256 values in relational databases. This uses the *URL*
/ *filename-friendly* character-set specified in
[&sect;5 of RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5) but
takes liberties (discussed tho not condoned in
[&sect;3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-3.2))
for specifying boundary conditions in a way that does not require padding for our use case.


## Format

As usual the encoding consists of mapping a sequence of 8-bit bytes to a
sequence of 6-bit data. We have 43 of these 6-bit sequences, with the first
6-bit sequence initialized as follows:

Consider a protocol in which we *prepend* every 32-byte sequence with an extra
0 byte: this 33-byte sequence would map to 44 base64 characters exactly. The
*first* character in every such base64 sequence would be redundant however,
since its value would be identically zero. Our protocol, then, requires that we drop
this leftmost zero.

More concretely consider a queue of bits added to on the right in chunks of 8 (byte) and consumed
on the left in chunks of 6 (base 64). The initialization, then, consists of filling this
bit-queue with 2 zero bits (followed by 8 bits from the first byte).

### One-to-One

Implementation-wise, the first 2 bits *could* be ignored (i.e. set them to
zero even if the base64 character read does not.) However, we *require padding bits be zero*
in order maintain a one-to-one mapping.

## Pros &amp; Cons

Compiled here to inform possible adoption.

### Pros

- *Compact*. Nearly 50% savings compared to hex.
- *URL friendly*. Does not need URL encoding.


### Cons

- *Broken Doubleclick Selection*. Doubleclicking selects the whole number
as one word if it's all alphanumeric; the '-' character is not alphanumeric, so
it breaks the selection.
- Not widely known.
